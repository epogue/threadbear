# For a thread started outside this repo (like ~/dev/me/misc), which gets
# no worktree from the runner: borrows one of the spares the runner keeps
# for new threads (docs/thread-worktrees.md, "Reusing worktrees"), with its
# Swift build caches, so the app builds in under a minute rather than the
# 5 to 10 a fresh `git worktree add` takes. With no spare it makes a new
# slot, which becomes one when it's given back.
#
#   ./borrow-worktree.sh              prints the worktree's path: detached
#                                     at main, set up, yours till you give it back
#   ./borrow-worktree.sh --give-back DIR
#                                     once everything in it is on main: back
#                                     in the pool for the next thread
#
# Unlocking a spare is the claim, the same as the runner's, so a thread and
# the runner never take the same one.
